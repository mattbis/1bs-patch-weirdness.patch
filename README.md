# weirdness.patch
## usages
1. you can also use this as a rough structure to patch some kinda project in this vein...
2. be aware most of this software is much earlier versions of the main build chain : since simplicity is vital as this is real time code. So therefore its not necessary a good idea to even try this. However I am hoping to notice no real difference and maybe include primitives to improve anything if necessary for the floating point stuff.... 
3. This is really a WIP and not advised to be used since I will likely make mistakes a few times.

.. investigation ( for 1 nd) (scene)
- I really love this plugin - and family
1. will you host a binary release: no... ( its not my project. I am only patching the plugins I notice have issue ( for me )  - most are fine - just this one at first )
2. 
### if not this work.0 then doc/graveyard/inv.md
1. try upgrade to 2019 `res/ide` / somehow i dont have or get 2017 anymore hmmm
2. try I think its just really old sdk usages they upgraded 2 since if I can rebuild it probably will work plus the defaults and floats if necessary stuff....
