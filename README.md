# weirdness.patch
.. investigation ( for 1 nd) (scene)
- this is a dev repo so I am literally working it out as we go .. 
- I really love this plugin - and family
1. will you host a binary release: no... ( its not my project. I am only patching the plugins I notice have issue ( for me )  - most are fine - just this one at first )
2. 
### if not this work.0 then `doc/graveyard/inv-possible.md`
1. try upgrade to 2019 `res/ide` / I realised 2017 is built into 2019 onwards apparently so it should work targeting that stack
2. its come to my attention in another plugin family by an extremely talented author that this could be a classic `subnormal` and `underrun` case... of course ! I didnt think of it.. the code is raw enough definitely for this to be the problem...
Then:-
4. try I think its just really old sdk usages they upgraded 2 since if I can rebuild it probably will work plus the defaults and floats if necessary stuff....
