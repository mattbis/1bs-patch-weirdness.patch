# weirdness.patch
.. investigation ( for 1 ) 
- I really love this plugin - and family - it(they) must not change it just has some combinations and memory issue i think with floats on complexity logarithm ( **ie the algorithms don't have sensbible boundaries to stop the over cpu**: we can check out some giants to see why they dont have this since is the same 2 tech .. .if only I could get 2 and 2017 working.
  - it could be callbacks... etc I dont see them since this is much older and very optimal code.
- two I notice some curious limits.. and wonder about this issue.. ( ie the output / active etc ) 
- commuc/native equations might happen somewhere to cause the bug
1. its most likely on restore state with above
### going to be quite the story since I dont really know cpp to this level yet..
1. i notice the code is dirty as hell though since I think i can make it stable.. 
2. omg host editor is too annoting: Editing xml. Considering paying for the lion is mayve gonna happen
### if it works to stop load corruption or i figure out some other reason that is it .. just one line if necessary
1. will you host a binary release: no...
## reasons
1. you can crash hosts on a few of them - its likely two issues.. etc
### work
1. upgrade to 2019
