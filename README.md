# weirdness.patch
.. investigation ( for 1 nd) 
- this plugin is really raw.. 
- I really love this plugin - and family - it(they) must not change it just has some combinations and memory issue i think with floats on complexity logarithm ( **ie the algorithms don't have sensbible boundaries to stop the over cpu**: we can check out some giants to see why they dont have this since is the same 2 tech .. .if only I could get 2 and 2017 working.
  - it could be callbacks... etc I dont see them since this is much older and very optimal code.
- two I notice some curious limits.. and wonder about this issue.. ( ie the output / active etc ) 
- commuc/native equations might happen somewhere to cause the bug
1. its most likely on restore state with above
### going to be quite the story since I dont really know cpp to this level yet..
1. the host can confuse you and this means its tricky to realise what it needs to fix it; ( for example dealloc somewhere ) or return state ()
2. omg host editor is too annoting: Editing xml. Considering paying for the lion is mayve gonna happen
### if it works to stop load corruption or i figure out some other reason that is it .. just one line if necessary
1. will you host a binary release: no... ( its not my project. I am only patching it )
## reasons
1. you can crash hosts on a few of them - its likely two issues.. etc. It seems maybe todo with bursts when i noticed it and allocation therefore ( guess ) 
### work
1. try upgrade to 2019 `res/ide`
2. try fix defaults `src/patch`
3. try fix max/min  `src/patch`
4. try to fix why gui change can use gain/complexity O() crash `src/patch`
