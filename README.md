# 1leg-scene-weirdness.patch
.. investigation
- I really love this plugin - it must not change it just has some combinations and memory issue i think with floats on complexity gain.
- two I notice some curious limits.. and wonder about this issue.. ( ie the output / active etc ) 
- communative equations might happen somewhere to cause the bug
### going to be quite the story since I dont really know cpp to this level yet..
1. i notice the code is dirty as hell though since I think i can make it stable.. 
2. omg host editor is too annoting: Editing xml. Considering paying for the lion is mayve gonna happen
### if it works to stop load corruption or i figure out some other reason that is it .. just one line if necessary
1. will you host a binary release: no...
