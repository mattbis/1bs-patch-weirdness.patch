# weirdness.patch
.. investigation ( for 1 nd) (scene)
- I really love this plugin - and family
1. will you host a binary release: no... ( its not my project. I am only patching the plugins I notice have issue ( for me )  - most are fine - just this one at first )
2. 
### if not this work.0 then `doc/graveyard/inv-possible.md`
1. try upgrade to 2019 `res/ide` / somehow i dont have or get 2017 anymore hmmm
2. try I think its just really old sdk usages they upgraded 2 since if I can rebuild it probably will work plus the defaults and floats if necessary stuff....
