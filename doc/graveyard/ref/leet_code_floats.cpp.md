1. using floats in ref to recent hosts...

how the hell is this happening where 65% are fine in this scenario but the others go weird. 

1. raw conversion and dangerous results from communicative and params and how it works etc

a. float over-runs and under-runs are notorious and interpolation for settings bad.,.. in this case our main bug is likeley the complexity gaining via the operands of the processors current evaluated function chain( im just guessing describing as i work it out )
b. say woudl it not be a bad idea to try and turn all floats into percents yes.. 
c. how these problems happen in some hosts is beyond me.. it should just work...
