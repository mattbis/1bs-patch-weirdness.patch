1. this is often using raw code
2. i notice modern code is really nothing like a lot of this.. its faster.
3. using bithacks and bitwise to get things faster.
4. usage of values, assignment, buffers, mod, rand, math ( trig tan/cos/sign etc )

5. is a kinda running journal of what i already know but am learning since you can do stuff i notice in a completely different project with unrolling alloc etc in lopps and all that stuff... 

6. from our previous projects I came to one conclusion the fastest thing is one function with everything local to it .. that you build etc..
