1. as mentioned I saw some code optimising a notorious unstable yet legendary game engine via a scripting engine , where the stuff its doing is malloc/pralloc/fralloc etc, and this get me thinking around however he is creating the samples in memory.. if we need..
2. this leads to a rabbit hole..

its important to note: we could enter a place we will never return from so we have to be careful.,
