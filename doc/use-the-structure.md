1. A - Never rehost anything CPR or CPL `binary` wise.. this is a very bad thing to do ... 
  i. just patch using this structure. Its not your binary. Therefore dont host a source as well so its easy for some to rip it off; unless they say its okay. IE. in some circumstances if there is no license.. you dont cross that boundary.
  i. all software has to respect the insane amount of learning and time it takes to even do this.. never cross that boundary.
3. B - Do not pester people with stupid requests.... ( in fact I would not even do this unless I had something working )
